eval.py, train* -  like in the project description,

*_VAE - contain classes that define VAE models,

*gamma* - do not work, they were supposed to implement Gamma Mixture Models, but I didn't manage to make them in time.

data should be placed in the folder data and named like files on GDrive, or path to it should be passed by  argparse
